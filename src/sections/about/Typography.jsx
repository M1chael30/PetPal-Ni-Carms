    Pet.pal is a web app where users can browse and select a "pal" (a dog) to
    spend time with, offering dog lovers the chance to enjoy companionship,
    bonding activities, and outdoor adventures for a few hours or a day. Ideal
    for those unable to commit to full-time pet ownership, Pet.pal enriches both
    users and dogs through shared experiencesâ€”with the option to adopt available
    dogs if a deeper connection forms.
